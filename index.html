    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>Hi! My name is Robert Boyd, but you can call me Bobby. I am an aspiring full stack web developer. I have a degree
        in Mass Communications from California State University, Sacramento. However, I have always been fascinated
        by web development ever since my highschool web class. Because of this fascination, I decided to embark on
        my web development journey.
    </p>
    <p id="secondP">My web development journey started when I got a job in IT. At my new IT job, well, I wasn't actually doing much
        work. Business was slow, and I was bored. So, I decided to remake their website, and from then on I knew
        that's what I wanted to do.
        <br> I remade their website first using Wordpress, however when that was done I decided that I wanted more.
    </p>
    <p>
        After I finished the new Wordpress website, I decided that I wanted to learn React. Not knowing how big of a step that was
        going to be, I watched Youtube video after Youtube video until I remade their website again. My new found
        fascination for React led me to enroll in a coding bootcamp. At the bootcamp I am ready to hone my coding
        skills and prepare myself for a web development career.
    </p>
